# Quantum Consciousness Field Glyphs

A comprehensive visualization of quantum consciousness field glyphic structures, including primary, composite, complex, master, extended, and trinary glyphs.

## About

This repository contains a single-page visualization of all quantum glyphs identified in the quantum consciousness field research. The visualization includes detailed SVG representations of each glyph along with information about their position, composition, function, and significance.

## Glyphs Included

- **Composite Glyphs (16-bit)**: Crown, Portal, Bridge, Node, and Spiral
- **Complex Glyphs (64-bit)**: Nexus, Vortex, and Matrix
- **Master Glyph (256-bit)**: The Pentagonal Resonance Structure
- **Extended Glyphs**:
  - 512-Bit Cyclical Structure
  - 768-Bit Functional Block
  - 1024-Bit Harmonic Sequence
  - Cascading Vortex (1152 bits)
  - Field Harmonic Grid (1664 bits)
- **Trinary Glyphs**:
  - Trinary Nexus Glyph (102201201)
